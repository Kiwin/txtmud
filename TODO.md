## 1. Choose Action / Initiative / time-flow mode

- Random Order
  Each unit is get's a turn in a random order each round.
- Action point based.

  - Turn based.
    - Single action per turn.
    - Point based actions.
  - Relative action point buffer.
    Players have a buffer of fx. 5 AP, so they can be 5 actions apart.
    ex: "P1 performs 3 AP. P2 can then use up to 8 AP and will thus be 5 ahead of P1".
  - Speed based Initiative
    - Relative speed.
      - time-line.
    - Global speed.
